How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    in windows command prompt:
       FC file1 file2
    in Mac or Linux terminal:
       diff file1 file2
       diff -u file1 file2   
       	    (-u gives more readable option, also more info)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?



git commit (take this point as a snaphot in history as an entry log)
git clone repository_url (copies all of the history not just files)
git config --global color.ui auto (changes color of diff output)
git diff log_id1 log_id2
